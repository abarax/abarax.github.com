# Blog status update #

No, the blog is not dead! I have just been really busy. This post is mostly an update on what I have been up to as well as a little bit about Clojure.

So what have I been up to? Well, it's mainly three things that have been keeping me really busy i.e. unable to post:

1) Matasano crypto challenges!
2) I've started a podcast!
3) I've joined a start up!

Those three things occurred chronologically since I last posted. Let me dive in to a little detail about them.

# Matasano Crypto Challenges #

For those of you who are not aware of Matasano I'll let you check the company summary out here:
