Title: Processing.js, Conway's Game of Life and Code Kata 
Category: Programming
Tags: processing

<script src="static/javascript/processing.js"></script>

I recently revisted the [Processing](http://processing.org) language/framework.  I had previously used processing when working on projects with my Arduino.

One of the latest developments is that of [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org) which brings your processing projects to the web. So I managed to knock something up to test it out. It was also an example of a problem I used for code kata the other day, Conway's Game of Life.

The code can be found on my github [here](https://www.github.com/abarax/game-of-life). Feel free to critique, constructive criticism is always welcome, everything is an exercise in learning.
