&lt;p&gt;Hi, I'm Leigh and this is my blog. I am a professional programmer, enthusiast hiker, serial hobbyist and avid gamer.  This is a place for me to document things I've learned or am interested in, explore new ideas, write-up interesting case studies, side-projects and hopefully much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why a blog?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years I have engaged in a number of extra-curricular activities, beyond my regular work duties.  This usually involves late nights filled with reading, coding and even soldering. Up until now I had never thought to share these endeavors but I feel like it could be a great opportunity to share and learn new things as well as meet like-minded people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What to expect&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a self-professed serial hobbyist you can expect that the topics I blog about will be as diverse as they are - hopefully, interesting.  For the most part they will involve topics related to programming, security, data analysis, algorithms, arduino and many others.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="blogging"></category></entry></feed>
