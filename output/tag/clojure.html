</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>No, the blog is not dead! I have just been really busy. This post is mostly an update on what I have been up to.</p>
<p>So what have I been up to? Well, apart from all the regular duties a life entails, it's three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Matasano crypto challenges!</li>
<li>I've started a podcast!</li>
<li>I'm bootstrapping a start up!</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these things has conspired to interfere with a regular blogging regime. Let me explain a little about each.</p>
<h1><a href="http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/">Matasano Crypto Challenges!</a></h1>
<p>For those of you who are not aware of Matasano I'll let you check them out <a href="www.matasano.com">here</a>. I have followed these guys for a long time, mostly in admiration and jealousy (just read their careers page to understand why).  I also follow the commentary of one of their esteemed co-founders <a href="www.twitter.com/tqbf">@tqbf</a> who happens to be a great commenter on hacker news. A lot of his posts are quite interesting and I seem to learn something new everytime I read one. </p>
<p>While browsing hacker news one day I stumbled upon a blog post which detailed an account of undertaking the Matasano Crypto Challenges (The blog post is <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2013/04/the_matasano_crypto_challenges/">here</a> and is quite good). Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, I was hooked.  So far I have spent about 20+ hours on the challenges and am currently up to round 3, question 21ish.  I decided to undertake these problems in python, mostly as a way of solidifying my knowledge of a language I am relatively new too.</p>
<p>I am hoping to find time to finish the 3rd set at least and I highly reccommend everyone who is interested in programming, security, cryptography or learning new things take up the challenge, it is extremely rewarding.</p>
<p>They do not want people to post their solutions so I wont. But if anyone wants to chat about the problems themselves or compare notes/solutions I would be very glad too. I currently only know one other person doing them and would love to share and speak with more.</p>
<h1><a href="www.hackandheckle.com">I've Started a podcast!</a></h1>
<p>So this one is exciting, myself along with two other programmers based in Brisbane (<a href="www.twitter.com/darrenrogan">@darrenrogan</a> and <a href="www.twitter.com/benedwinmorgan">@benedwinmorgan</a>) have started a podcast!  The podcast is mostly about tech news, programming and the meetup scene is Brisbane, but may touch on any number of things that interest us.</p>
<p>It is titled Hack and Heckle and the website is at (www.hackandheckle.com). Please check us out and have a listen, we need feedback and questions! We are also hoping to interview some local tech notables, so if you have any suggestions let us know.</p>
<h1>I'm bootstrapping a side project!</h1>
<p>The final and certainly most significant thing that has begun to develop is the beginning of a side project.</p>
<p>Currently I am the sole backend engineer and have been using and enjoying <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> + the very cool <a href="http://django-rest-framework.org/">Django REST Framework</a> deployed to <a href="aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a> I have also been helping out in the frontend for which we are using <a href="emberjs.com">Ember.js</a>.  Currently we arn't speaking about it in public as we are in full development but stay tuned as there may be more news to follow.  I will at least attempt to chronicle my use of the technologies.</p><p>There are <a href="http://www.leighappel.com/blog-status-update.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>                </article>
